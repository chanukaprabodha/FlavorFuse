    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400ml coconut cream</li>
        <li>20g fresh yeast, or fast-action dried yeast 7g</li>
        <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>500g rice flour</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>for the pan vegetable oil</li>
        <li>to serve (optional) eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol><li>Stir the coconut cream, yeast and sugar in a bowl and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes or until risen and
        frothy.</li><br>
        <li>Sift the rice flour into the mixture and whisk until a smooth batter forms. Cover the bowl and leave in a warm
            place for 3-4 hours or until the batter has doubled in size - the rising time will vary considerably depending
            on the room temperature (the warmer, the better). Just before cooking, lightly beat the egg whites with a fork
            until they are foamy, then stir into the hopper mixture with 1 tsp of salt.</li><br>
            <li>Heat a hopper pan or a small non-stick frying pan over a high heat, wipe the pan lightly with oil, then pour in a
                60ml ladleful of the mixture. Swirl to coat the sides of the pan, leaving a small pool of mixture in the centre.
                Crack in an egg (if using), then cover the pan with a lid and steam the hopper for 2-3 minutes or until the
                centre is firm and the sides are golden and crisp. Keep the cooked hoppers warm and repeat the process until all
                the batter has been used.</li><br>
