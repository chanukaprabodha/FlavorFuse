                <h1>Pol Roti</h1>
                <p>Classic Sri Lankan pol roti – A coconut roti (coconut flatbread) that is easy to make and uniquely
                    delicious! If
                    you’re bored with your regular flatbreads, then here’s a fun and delicious variation to try, that
                    doesn’t
                    require any leavening agent.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>400 g AP flour [Volume measurements measured by spoon and level method, into a cup]</li>
                    <li> 150 g shredded desiccated coconut [unsweetened. OR Freshly grated coconut (which is better!)]
                    </li>
                    <li> 1 ¼ tsp sea salt</li>
                    <li> 1 medium red onion [Finely chopped (generous ½ cup)]</li>
                    <li> 3 long, green chili [Halved lengthwise and sliced finely. Use less if you prefer. Also de-seed
                        the green
                        chili, if you don't want the heat.]</li>
                    <li> 120 mL coconut milk [full fat preferred]</li>
                    <li> 120 mL water</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the flour, desiccated coconut, salt, onion, and chili in a large bowl. Mix to combine
                        well.
                        400 g AP flour,150 g shredded desiccated coconut,1 ¼ tsp sea salt,1 medium red onion,3 long,
                        green chili
                    </li><br>
                    <li> Mix the water and coconut milk in another bowl or jug.
                        120 mL coconut milk,120 mL water</li><br>
                    <li> Add the liquid to the flour mixture, a little at a time, while stirring the flour with your
                        fingertips (or
                        with a fork).</li><br>
                    <li> After adding about ½ of the liquid, gently stir the mixture. You will have some clumps and dry
                        spots of
                        flour. Drizzle the liquid over the dry parts of the flour, while mixing, to form a dough.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Add 1 or 2 more tbsp of water ONLY if needed. The dough should come together, but still have
                        dry spots on
                        the surface. This is OK.</li><br>
                    <li> If you add too much water, sprinkle in a little extra flour and lightly knead it into the dough
                        (don’t
                        over-knead!). Shape the dough into a rough ball.</li><br>
                    <li> Cover the dough (or the bowl) with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 4 hours, or
                        up to 12
                        hours (room temperature is fine). If you want to store the dough for up to 24 hours, then
                        refrigerate it.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> The dough should become really soft after it has rested. If it’s very sticky, generously flour
                        the dough
                        and
                        the work surface to prevent it from sticking to your counter.</li><br>
                    <li> Transfer the dough to your floured work surface. Cut the dough into 8 wedges. Lightly roll up
                        each section
                        into a rough ball. See pictures in the post.</li><br>
                    <li> Take each dough ball and sprinkle some flour on top and on the work surface. Flatten it to a
                        disc, and then
                        roll it out to a circle using a rolling pin. The roti should be about 0.4 - 0.5 cm thick, and
                        about 12 -15
                        cm (5 - 6 inches) in diameter. Cover the rolled out roti with a cloth napkin or plastic wrap (so
                        that it
                        doesn't dry out), and repeat rolling out all of the dough portions.</li><br>
                    <li> Preheat a cast iron skillet or non-stick skillet over medium or medium high heat.</li><br>
                    <li> When the pan is heated, transfer a roti onto the skillet and cook for about 2 - 3 minutes,
                        until the bottom
                        starts to develop brown spots.</li><br>
                    <li> Flip the roti over and cook the other side for 2 - 3 minutes, until you get brown spots on that
                        side too.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> Place the cooked roti on a wire rack to cool down. Repeat with the rest of the roti.</li><br>
                    <li> Eat the roti warm or at room temperature.</li><br>
