                <h1>Chinese Rolls</h1>
                <p>Sri Lankan Chinese Rolls are bit of a misnomer. They are a uniquely Sri Lankan savory snack (or
                    “short eat” as
                    known in the island). Fried savory crepe rolls filled with a spicy, flavor-packed meat filling,
                    although it can
                    also often be a fish or vegetarian filling.</p>

                <h2>Crepes for Chinese Rolls</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                    <li>1 cup flour</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons melted butter</li>
                    <li>Oil for coating the pan</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl beat the eggs, water, salt and butter till well combined.</li><br>
                    <li> Whisk the flour into the egg mixture until it is smooth with no clumps.</li><br>
                    <li> Add the milk into the mixture and whisk to mix well.</li><br>
                    <li> Alternatively, you can add all the ingredients into a food processor or blender and process the
                        mix until
                        smooth and mixed well.</li><br>
                    <li> Leave the batter for about 30 minutes to rest.</li><br>
                    <li> Heat a 9 inch flat pan (a crepe pan) over medium heat and lightly coat it with some oil. (I
                        brushed the oil
                        using a pastry brush).</li><br>
                    <li> When pan is heated, ladle just enough batter to thinly coat the bottom of the pan (about 1/4 a
                        cup or less
                        – depending on how thick the batter is).</li><br>
                    <li> Let the crepes cook for about 20 seconds (unlike regular crepes, you do not want these to
                        colour), flip
                        them and cook for another 10-20 seconds until crepes are cooked through, slightly crispy on the
                        edges, but
                        with
                        little colour on them).</li><br>
                    <li>Transfer crepe onto a plate. You can easily pile the crepes on top of each other until the next
                        step.</li>
                    <br>

                <h2>Filling for Chinese Rolls</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>500 g of mince or finely chopped beef.</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp of curry powder [you can use your favorite curry powder]</li>
                    <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
                    <li>1/2 of a large onion chopped</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp of chilli flakes</li>
                    <li>1-2 jalapeno/serrano peppers sliced [seeds removed to reduce heat]</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of mild chilli powder [optional – use as much or as little as you like. We like it spicy
                        so used more
                        chilli powder]</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup tomato sauce</li>
                    <li>1/2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
                    <li>More salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a pan, heat a tablespoon of oil on medium heat.</li><br>
                    <li>When heated, add the onions and cook them for a few minutes until they soften.</li><br>
                    <li>Add the curry powder, garlic, salt, chilli powder (if using), chilli flakes and green chilli.
                        Cook these
                        spices together for a few seconds.</li><br>
                    <li> Add the beef/lamb and mix it through with the spices, and let them cook for about 10 minutes or
                        longer
                        until
                        it’s cooked through.</li><br>
                    <li>Add the brown sugar and tomato sauce and mix it in with the meat. Let it cook further (you are
                        looking for
                        the meat to be moist and cooked well, but without any sauce left so that it’s dry enough to go
                        in the
                        crepes).</li><br>
                </ol>

                    <li>Bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>Crepes [about 15-20]</li>
                    <li>1 recipe of the filling</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Method</h3>

                    <li>In another tray/plate, place about a cup or more of breadcrumbs (you will end up using more, but
                        it’s
                        easier
                        to work with a little at a time).</li><br>
                    <li>On a cutting board or plate, place 1 crepe. Then place 2-3 heaping tablespoons of the filling as
                        shown

                    </li><br>
                    <li>Start rolling the filling away from you to form a roll. Place the rolled up crepe rolls on the
                        tray
                        until
                        they are ready to be coated with bread crumbs. Please see Note 1.</li><br>
                    <li>Take a crepe roll and coat it well with the beaten egg mixture. Maker sure that you coat the two
                        ends of
                        the
                        roll as well.</li><br>
                    <li>Then cover this with bread crumbs, and place it back on the tray. Please see Note 2 <br>

                    <li>Heat some vegetable oil, or shortening till it reaches about 340 F.</li><br>
                    <li>Deep fry the rolls without over-crowding the pan, until they turn golden brown.</li><br>
