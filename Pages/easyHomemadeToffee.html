        <h1>Easy Homemade Toffee</h1>
        <p>
          An unbelievably easy, no-fuss, homemade toffee recipe. So addictive,
          you won’t want to share!

          When I was in the 7th grade, one of the girls in my history class
          always brought in the most amazing homemade toffee. She said that her
          mom would make it during the holidays and we would all surround her
          during break time to make sure we got our hands on this amazing
          toffee. <br /><br />
          Well, I’m happy to say that after 12 years of trying my first homemade
          toffee, I can finally cross this off on my culinary bucket list.

          Now this toffee recipe is unbelievably easy. The only hard part I
          could think of is the caramelization process but I promise you, it’s
          not difficult at all. It’s a simple stir-and-watch process until it
          turns an almond brown. That’s it! No candy thermometer or fancy
          gadgets needed. <br /><br />
          But I guess the real hard part is waiting the 2 hours for this to cool
          so you could finally stuff your face with this. Just be warned that
          you will not want to share this with anyone so if you plan on making
          this for gift-giving, I commend you on your self-control.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup raw almonds</li>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
          <li>1 cup sugar</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>⅓ cup pecans, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
            paper or a silicone baking mat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread almonds in an even layer onto the prepared baking sheet.
            Place into oven and bake until toasted, about 10 minutes; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a medium saucepan, combine butter, sugar vanilla and salt over
            medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until butter has melted and
            mixture is almond brown in color, about 10-15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately spread the hot caramel mixture evenly over the almonds.
            Sprinkle with chocolate chips. After 1-2 minutes, spread the
            chocolate chips in an even layer until smooth. Sprinkle with pecans.
          </li>
          <li>Let cool completely, about 2 hours. Break into pieces.</li>
