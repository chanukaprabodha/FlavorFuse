    <h1>Watalappan (coconut custard with kithul)</h1>
    <p>Kithul syrup - also known as kithul treacle - is a Sri Lankan syrup made from unrefined palm sugar. It lends
        these puddings a rich, caramel-like flavour and whispers of date and honey</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 lb natural dark brown molasses sugar or finely grated kitul jaggery</li>
        <li>⅛ cup hot water</li>
        <li>3 -4 cardamom pod seeds crushed (just over ¼ tsp)</li>
        <li>¼ tsp of nutmeg (If using fresh nutmeg, use less as it will be more potent)</li>
        <li>2 cups of thick coconut milk [First press milk] (if the coconut milk is lumpy - which can happen in cold
            weather - warm it up to dissolve the lumps)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 320°F / 160°C</li><br>
        <li>Oil and prepare 7-8, ½ cup capacity ramekins.</li><br>
        <li>in a large bowl combine the sugar and water and stir until it becomes a paste with no lumps (the sugar does
            not need
            to dissolve completely)</li><br>
        <li>Add the eggs and egg yolk, spices and salt and whisk until well combined – i.e. till the egg mixture becomes
            very
            slightly thick (not the “ribbony stage,” just enough to thoroughly mix the sugar and eggs). Take care not to
            make
            the egg mixture frothy.</li><br>
        <li>Add the 2 cups of coconut milk and whisk well.</li><br>
        <li>Pour the mix into the prepared ramekins (or a large dish if you prefer). Cover the ramekins / dish with
            foil.</li><br>
        <li>Bake the ramekins/dish in a water bath for about 30 – 40 minutes for the ramekins and up to an hour if in a
            large
            dish, depending on the depth of it. You want the custard to set, but the middle to be very slightly wobbly.
        </li><br>
        <li> Remove from the oven and let them cool for about 15 minutes in the water bath.</li><br>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, remove them from the water bath and cover the ramekins with plastic wrap, and
            place it
            in the fridge to chill for at least 3 hours (longer for larger dishes). Best chilled overnight.</li><br>
        <li>Serve as is, or with some cashew nuts on top.
        </li>
        <br>
    </ol>
