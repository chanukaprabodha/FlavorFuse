        <h1>Sourdough Biscuits</h1>
        <p>
          Use up your “discarded” starter in these EPIC biscuits! With that
          sourdough tang, these biscuits are so flaky, so buttery + so so good.

          With the recent pandemic, everyone started baking bread, particularly
          sourdough – hence the yeast shortage (right behind toilet paper and
          Purell, of course). <br /><br />
          I, myself, tried my hand at sourdough. I was not successful. Hence my
          weekly no knead bread baking.

          But I did have a ton of discarded sourdough. So I made some pancakes.
          Which were of course, amazing. And then I made some biscuits. And it
          was legit NEXT LEVEL EPIC. <br /><br />
          The added sourdough tang knocks these biscuits right out of the park.
          Not to mention, the ultra flaky, light and fluffiness these biscuits
          encompass.

          Just be sure to serve them super warm with all the melted butter. And
          this works as an appetizer, snack or dinner. <br /><br />
          I prefer to have them for dinner though.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, frozen</li>
            <li>1 cup active sourdough starter</li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Method</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment
              paper or a silicone baking mat.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and
              baking soda.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              Grate butter using the large holes of a box grater. Stir into the
              flour mixture.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, whisk together sourdough starter and buttermilk.
              Add to the flour mixture and stir using a rubber spatula until a
              soft dough forms.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 2-3 times
              until it comes together. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into
              a 1 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Cut out 8-10 rounds using a 2-inch
              biscuit or cookie cutter.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              Place biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and
              bake for 14-18 minutes, or until golden brown.
            </li><br>
            <li>Serve warm.</li>
