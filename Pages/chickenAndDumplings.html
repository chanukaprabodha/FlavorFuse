        <h1>Chicken and Dumplings</h1>
        <p>
          A creamy, hearty chicken stew with vegetables and homemade light and
          fluffy dumplings! Comes together so quick too!

        <p>
          Creamy chicken noodle soup with tender, pillowy dumplings? Yes. So
          much yes. <br /><br />
          This is true comfort food at its finest without any canned biscuits or
          canned soup of any kind. The dumplings are made completely from
          scratch with a few pantry staples (unsalted butter, self-raising flour
          and buttermilk), and they’re super easy to whip up too.
        </p>

        <p>
          And you get to repurpose leftover rotisserie chicken so this comes
          together very fast, making this absolutely weeknight worthy,
          especially on a cold, snowy day. Or really any other cold day where we
          just need a big hug in a bowl.

          <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
          <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 ¼ teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
          <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>4 cups coarsely shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
          <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
          <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
          <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>½ cup frozen green peas, thawed</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the dumplings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold</li>
          <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
          <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
            onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
            tender, about 3-4 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Stir in garlic and poultry seasoning until fragrant, about 1 minute.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Stir in chicken, chicken stock and wine. Bring to a boil; reduce
            heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavors
            have blended, about 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Stir in heavy cream; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Working in batches, gently stir in dumplings. Cover, reduce heat and
            simmer, stirring occasionally, until dumplings are cooked through
            and tender, about 5-8 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Stir in peas and parsley until heated through, about 1-2 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Serve immediately.</li>
          <br />
        </ol>

        <h3>For the dumplings</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grate butter using the large holes of a box grater. Stir into the
            flour.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Add buttermilk and stir using a rubber spatula until a soft dough
            forms.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 3-4 times
            until it comes together. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into
            1/4-inch thickness. Cut dough into bite-size pieces.
          </li>
        </ol>
